//! Arm instruction manipulator.
//!
//! This library is meant to be used by assemblers and disassembler, emulators, etc.
//! That is to leverage encoding and decoding of instructions.
//!
//! The goal of this project is to fully implement all Arm32 instruction set architectures, and, hopefully, Arm64 architectures as well.
