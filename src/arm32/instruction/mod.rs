/// An Arm32 instruction.
///
/// An instruction must be encoded before it can be used by a processor.
/// This can be done using the [`InstructionCodec`](crate::arm32::InstructionCodec) type.
///
/// Do note that these enumerations do not exactly match instructions used in assembly.
/// For example, the following two lines are completely identical (with respect to the final binary, disregarding optimisations):
///
/// ```as
/// CPY r1, r0
/// MOV r1, r0
/// ```
///
/// Yet only `MOV` ([`Move`](Instruction::Move)) is provided as a variant.
/// Similarly, some combinations of operands yield the same results as multiple instructions.
/// See [`Shifter`] for more information.
///
/// Also note that not all operands can be encoded in Arm instruction sets.
/// Even the largest immediates usually have a limit at (24) significant figures.
