/// Codec for encoding and decoding instruction.
///
/// Arm instructions can be encoded/decoded using the [`encode_arm`](InstructionCodec::encode_arm) and `decode_arm` (soon).
/// Thumb instruction will similarly be manipulated using [`encode_thumb`](InstructionCodec::encode_thumb) and `decode_thumb`.
///
/// This structure keeps track of the adress at which instructions are to be placed (see *Rationale*).
/// If encoding causes this internal address to go past `0xFFFFFFFF`, the value is safely wrapped to the origin (i.e. `0x00000000`).
///
/// # Rationale
///
/// This structure is useful for the few functions that encode differently according to their position.
///
/// For example `B 0x08000000` encodes the immediate (in this case `0x08000000`) as an offset from `PC`.
/// This is despite taking an address as its operand in assembly.
