/// A shifter operand.
///
/// Some Arm instructions take these to minimise instruction usage.
/// For example, the following code:
///
/// ```as
/// LSL r1, r1, #2
/// ADD r0, r1
/// ```
///
/// is functionally equivalent to:
///
/// ```as
/// ADD r0, r1, LSL #2
/// ```
///
/// In fact, the mentioned `LSL` instruction will encode identically to the following:
///
/// ```as
/// MOV r1, r1, LSL #2
/// ```
///
/// # Immediates
///
/// Shifters can store any immediate value with the [`Immediate`](Shifter::Immediate) variant.
///
/// In theory, these values are limited to *at most* `24` bits on Arm, and to `11` bits on Thumb.
/// In practice, however, these are even further limited -- in some cases down to `3` bits.
///
/// # Shifts
///
/// As mentioned, shifters can also incorporate the functionality of other instructions.
/// This is done as *shifts* (hence the name *shifter*), and can use one of the following functions:
///
/// * Logical shift left --- `LSL`
/// * Logical shift right --- `LSR`
/// * Arithmetic shift right --- `ASR`
/// * Rotate right --- `ROR`
/// * Rotate right extend --- `RRX`
///
/// With the exception of `RRX`, all of these functions can take a *shift value* -- which sets the ammount of digits to shifts -- from either an immediate or a register.
/// For immediates, this is limited to the range `1` to `32`, inclusive, except for `LSL`, which uses the range `0` to `31` (again inclusive; see also *Registers*).
///
/// Therefore, the following two examples are somewhat equivalent:
///
/// ```as
/// ; First example:
/// ADD r0, r0, r1, LSL #1
///
/// ; Second example:
/// MOV r2, #1
/// ADD r0, r0, r1, LSL r2
/// ```
///
/// Of course, the first example has a smaller memory footprint and a (in theory) shorter runtime.
///
/// ## Registers
///
/// Whilst lone registers are accepted as shifter operands, they aren't encoded specially.
/// Instead, a single, unshifted register is encoded as itself shifted to the left by zero figures:
///
/// ```as
/// ; These are identical:
/// RSB r0, r0, r7
/// RSB r0, r0, r7, LSL #0
/// ```
///
/// This instead makes `LSL` a special case in that it cannot encode shift ammounts of `32` figures -- in contrast to the other shift functions.
